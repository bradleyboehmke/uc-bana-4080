UC BANA 4080 Data Mining
================

**By [Brad Boehmke](https://github.com/bradleyboehmke) ðŸš€**


Welcome to **BANA 4080: Introduction to Data Mining with Python**. This course provides an immersive, hands-on introduction to the tools and techniques used in modern data science. Youâ€™ll learn how to explore, analyze, and model data using Python and gain practical experience through labs, projects, and real-world datasets. Note - the following is a truncated syllabus; for the full syllabus along with complete course content please visit the online course content in [Canvas](https://uc.instructure.com/). 

## Course Description

This course introduces students to the foundational concepts of data science through the lens of Python programming. Students will develop core skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and modeling using real-world data. The second half of the course introduces key machine learning techniquesâ€”including supervised, unsupervised, and deep learningâ€”and concludes with an introduction to generative AI and large language models (LLMs).

By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Use Python to read, clean, transform, and visualize data
- Apply exploratory and statistical techniques to understand datasets
- Build and evaluate basic machine learning models
- Gain exposure to cutting-edge techniques like deep learning and LLMs
