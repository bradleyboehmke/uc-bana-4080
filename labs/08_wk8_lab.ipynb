    "<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/bradleyboehmke/uc-bana-4080/blob/main/labs/08_wk8_lab.ipynb\" target=\"_parent\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"/></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first hands-on machine learning lab! Today you'll work as data science consultants, helping organizations plan their ML projects before building any models. You'll practice the critical thinking and planning skills that separate successful ML projects from costly failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Transform vague business requests into clear, actionable ML problem statements\n",
    "- Design appropriate train/test split strategies based on data characteristics\n",
    "- Identify potential data leakage risks and mitigation strategies\n",
    "- Assess fairness, privacy, and interpretability concerns for ML applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìö This Lab Reinforces\n",
    "- **Chapter 19: Introduction to Machine Learning and AI**\n",
    "- **Chapter 20: Before We Build - Key Considerations**\n",
    "- **Tuesday Lecture: ML Fundamentals and Planning**\n",
    "\n",
    "## üïê Estimated Time & Structure\n",
    "**Total Time:** 75 minutes  \n",
    "**Mode:** Group work (teams of 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[0‚Äì10 min]** Lab introduction and team formation\n",
    "- **[10‚Äì60 min]** Group planning session (50 minutes)\n",
    "- **[60‚Äì75 min]** Team presentations and wrap-up\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Why This Matters\n",
    "Before you can build effective machine learning models, you must master the art of project planning. Studies show that 85% of ML projects fail not because of poor algorithms, but because of inadequate planning around problem definition, data quality, and ethical considerations. Today's skills will prevent you from building technically impressive models that solve the wrong problems or fail in real-world deployment."

    "### Key Learning Outcomes\n",
    "After completing this lab, you should understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem framing is critical** - vague business requests must be transformed into specific, measurable ML problems\n",
    "2. **Data strategy matters** - the way you split and handle data can make or break your model's real-world performance\n",
    "3. **Leakage is sneaky** - future information can slip into training data in subtle ways that destroy model validity\n",
    "4. **Ethics are essential** - fairness, privacy, and interpretability must be considered from the start, not as an afterthought\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "Consider these questions individually:\n",
    "- Which aspect of ML planning was most challenging for your team?\n",
    "- What surprised you about the complexity of \"simple\" business requests?\n",
    "- How would you approach your scenario differently after hearing other teams?\n",
    "- What connections do you see between today's planning concepts and previous data analysis work?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- **Homework:** Submit your team's PowerPoint presentation\n",
    "- **Next Tuesday:** Introduction to specific ML algorithms and implementation\n",
    "- **Upcoming Labs:** Hands-on model building using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Application\n",
    "The planning skills you practiced today are exactly what data scientists use in industry. Companies pay consultants thousands of dollars for the type of analysis you just completed. These foundational planning skills will serve you throughout your data science career, regardless of which specific algorithms or tools you eventually use.\n",
