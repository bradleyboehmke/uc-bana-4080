    "\n",
    "### Getting Students Ready\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Launch the Colab Notebook**\n",
    "   - Direct students to click the \"Open in Colab\" badge at the top of the lab notebook\n",
    "   - Alternative: Share direct Colab link if needed\n",
    "   - Ensure everyone can access and edit their own copy\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Form Groups**\n",
    "   - **Group size:** 2-4 students (slightly larger groups okay for this lab)\n",
    "   - **Seating:** Have groups sit close together for easy collaboration\n",
    "   - **Collaborative work:** Groups work together throughout\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Expectations**\n",
    "   - **Part A:** We'll work through together - follow along and ask questions\n",
    "   - **Part B:** Independent group work - TAs will circulate and provide hints\n",
    "   - **Pacing:** It's okay if groups move at different speeds\n",
    "   - **Professional Approach:** Emphasize that we're learning industry-standard practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Setup Issues\n",
    "- **Internet required:** This lab uses URL data import, so stable connection needed\n",
    "- **Pandas import:** Should work automatically in Colab\n",
    "- **Dataset size:** College COVID data is moderately large - may take a moment to load"

    "\n",
    "### Introduction & Philosophy (3 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Opening Message:**\n",
    "> \"Today you're becoming data detectives. Every professional data scientist follows the same systematic approach when they encounter a new dataset. We're going to learn these essential investigation habits.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Connection to Course Materials:**\n",
    "- \"Remember from Tuesday's slides - we're becoming data detectives\"\n",
    "- \"This reinforces what you read in Chapters 7-9\"\n",
    "- \"These are professional habits you'll use in every analysis\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### A1. Import the Dataset (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teaching Approach:**\n",
    "- Have everyone run the import code together\n",
    "- Explain URL vs local file importing (connection to Chapter 7)\n",
    "- Preview the data briefly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Teaching Points:**\n",
    "- \"This is real data from the New York Times\"\n",
    "- \"Notice we're importing from a URL - this is common in data science\"\n",
    "- \"Always take a first look with `.head()` after importing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### A2. Systematic Data Investigation (10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teaching Strategy:**\n",
    "- **Work through each \"detective question\" together**\n",
    "- **Have students run code as you demonstrate**\n",
    "- **Emphasize the systematic approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code through each detective question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset size:** \"Always start with `.shape` - how big is our investigation?\"\n",
    "2. **Variables available:** \"`.columns` tells us what information we have\"\n",
    "3. **Data preview:** \"`.head()` and `.tail()` give us a sense of the data\"\n",
    "4. **Data types:** \"`.info()` is incredibly valuable - types AND missing data\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**üí° Teaching Moments:**\n",
    "- \"Notice how `.info()` shows missing values - this is crucial for data quality\"\n",
    "- \"We ask these same 5 questions for EVERY dataset we encounter\"\n",
    "- \"This systematic approach saves time and prevents mistakes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### A2.5. DataFrame vs Series Mastery (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Concept - Spend Time Here:**\n",
    "- \"This distinction trips up many data scientists - let's master it now\"\n",
    "- Have students run each comparison and observe outputs\n",
    "- Emphasize the shape differences and when to use each\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Teaching Points:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Single brackets = Series (1D)\n",
    "college_df['cases']        # Returns Series\n",
    "\n",
    "# Double brackets = DataFrame (2D) \n",
    "college_df[['cases']]      # Returns DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple columns = DataFrame\n",
    "college_df[['state', 'college', 'cases']]  # Returns DataFrame\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Golden Rule:** \"Use `[[]]` when you want to keep working with DataFrame methods!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### A2.6. Attributes vs Methods (3 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teaching Focus:**\n",
    "- \"Professional code uses the right syntax\"\n",
    "- \"Attributes = properties, no parentheses needed\"\n",
    "- \"Methods = actions, always need parentheses\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Device:** \"Methods = Actions = Parentheses!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### A3. Focus the Investigation (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teaching Approach:**\n",
    "- \"Real investigations focus on relevant variables\"\n",
    "- Show column selection with multiple columns\n",
    "- Demonstrate how this creates a more manageable dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### A3.5. Index Investigation (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Concept - Take Your Time:**\n",
    "- \"Indexes make data access faster and code more readable\"\n",
    "- Show current index (RangeIndex)\n",
    "- Demonstrate checking for uniqueness\n",
    "- Show `.set_index()` example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** \"Good indexes enable fast lookups, but need unique values\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### A4. Professional Subsetting Practice (7 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Important Section - Go Slowly:**\n",
    "- \"`.loc[]` is the professional standard for filtering\"\n",
    "- Work through the 3-step process:\n",
    "  1. Create condition (boolean Series)\n",
    "  2. Apply filter with `.loc[]`\n",
    "  3. Analyze results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code through examples together:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Step 1: Create condition\n",
    "ohio_condition = college_cases_df['state'] == 'Ohio'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Apply filter\n",
    "ohio_colleges = college_cases_df.loc[ohio_condition]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Analyze\n",
    "total_cases = ohio_colleges['cases'].sum()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Example:** Show combining conditions with `&`\n",
    "\n",
    "### A4 Wrap-Up (2 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforce Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- \"We've learned the data detective methodology\"\n",
    "- \"DataFrame vs Series - when to use each\"\n",
    "- \"Professional filtering with `.loc[]`\"\n",

    "- \"Most of the time, use double brackets to stay with DataFrames\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Why use `.loc[]` instead of just `[]`?\"**\n",
    "- \"`.loc[]` is more explicit and professional\"\n",
    "- \"It's safer and avoids pandas warnings\"\n",
    "- \"Industry standard - makes your code look professional\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"I keep forgetting parentheses on methods\"**\n",
    "- \"Remember: Methods = Actions = Parentheses\"\n",
    "- \"If it DOES something, it needs parentheses\"\n",
    "- \"If it's just a property, no parentheses\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"The condition syntax is confusing\"**\n",
    "- Show the pattern: `df[df['column'] == value]`\n",
    "- \"First `df` is what we're filtering\"\n",
    "- \"Second `df['column'] == value` creates the condition\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"What if I use `and` instead of `&`?\"**\n",
    "- \"Python's `and`/`or` don't work with pandas\"\n",
    "- \"Always use `&` (and) and `|` (or) with pandas\"\n",
    "- \"Wrap each condition in parentheses\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### Final 5 Minutes: Celebrate & Connect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acknowledge Progress:**\n",
    "- \"You've learned the systematic approach that professional data scientists use\"\n",
    "- \"These data detective skills will serve you in every analysis\"\n",
    "- \"You can now confidently approach any new dataset\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Mastered:**\n",
    "1. **Systematic data investigation** (the 5 detective questions)\n",
    "2. **DataFrame vs Series distinction** and when to use each\n",
    "3. **Professional subsetting** with `.loc[]`\n",
    "4. **Index concepts** for efficient data access\n",
    "5. **Attributes vs methods** for clean code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preview Next Week:**\n",
    "- \"Next week: Data manipulation and aggregation\"\n",
    "- \"You'll use these detective skills to clean and transform data\"\n",
    "- \"We'll build on the filtering techniques you learned today\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encourage Continued Practice:**\n",
    "- \"Apply these detective questions to any dataset you encounter\"\n",
    "- \"Practice the DataFrame vs Series distinction\"\n",
    "- \"Use `.loc[]` consistently to build professional habits\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collecting Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Pulse Check:**\n",
    "- \"Thumbs up if you feel confident about the data detective approach\"\n",
    "- \"Thumbs up if DataFrame vs Series distinction is clear\"\n",
    "- \"What was the most valuable concept from today?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Your Own Reflection:**\n",
    "- Did students grasp the DataFrame vs Series distinction?\n",
    "- Were the systematic investigation questions well-received?\n",
    "- How was the pacing between guided and independent work?\n",
    "- Which concepts need more reinforcement in future labs?\n",

    "## üÜò Emergency Solutions & Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Won't Load:**\n",
    "- Check internet connection\n",
    "- Try reloading the URL in a browser first\n",
    "- Backup plan: Use a simple local CSV if available\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas Import Errors:**\n",
    "- Try `!pip install pandas` in a code cell\n",
    "- Restart kernel (Runtime > Restart runtime)\n",
    "- Verify cell type is \"Code\" not \"Text\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Issues:**\n",
    "- Dataset is moderately large (~1000+ rows)\n",
    "- Use `.head()` liberally to avoid printing full dataset\n",
    "- If very slow, focus on concepts over execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataFrame vs Series Struggles:**\n",
    "- Use visual analogies: \"DataFrame = entire spreadsheet, Series = one column\"\n",
    "- Show the shape difference clearly: `(rows, columns)` vs `(rows,)`\n",
    "- Practice with simple examples using fewer rows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filtering Syntax Issues:**\n",
    "- Break down into steps: \"First create condition, then apply filter\"\n",
    "- Use simpler conditions first: just `==` before moving to `&`\n",
    "- Show the boolean Series that conditions create\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index Confusion:**\n",
    "- Start with default RangeIndex explanation\n",
    "- Show how custom indexes enable fast lookups\n",
    "- Don't worry about advanced index operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pacing Adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "**If Running Behind in Part A:**\n",
    "- Focus on DataFrame vs Series and basic filtering\n",
    "- Spend less time on index concepts\n",
    "- Shorten Q&A to 5 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**If Running Behind in Part B:**\n",
    "- Focus on Challenges 1-3 (core concepts)\n",
    "- Show solutions more quickly\n",
    "- Emphasize understanding over completion\n",
    "\n",
    "**If Groups Are Struggling:**\n",
    "- Do more challenges together as a class\n",
    "- Focus on conceptual understanding\n",
    "- Reduce challenge scope but ensure comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: **Your goal is deep understanding of core concepts, not rushing through all material.** Better for students to truly grasp DataFrame vs Series distinction and basic filtering than to superficially cover everything."
