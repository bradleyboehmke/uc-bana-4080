    "## üéØ Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Import tabular data into a Pandas DataFrame using multiple methods\n",
    "- Systematically explore dataset structure using data detective techniques\n",
    "- Distinguish between DataFrames and Series and know when to use each\n",
    "- Apply professional subsetting techniques to filter and select data\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìö This Lab Reinforces\n",
    "- **Chapter 7**: Importing Data (file paths, data types, inspection methods)\n",
    "- **Chapter 8**: DataFrames (Series, indexing, attributes vs methods)\n",
    "- **Chapter 9**: Subsetting (filtering, selection, `.loc[]` best practices)\n",
    "\n",
    "## üïê Estimated Time & Structure\n",
    "**Total Time:** 75 minutes  \n",
    "**Mode:** Group-first, then Q&A, then group challenges\n",

    "- **[0‚Äì40 min]** Part A: Guided Data Detective Training\n",

    "In this lab, you practiced:\n",
    "- **Systematic data investigation** using the data detective methodology\n",
    "- **DataFrame vs Series distinction** and when to use each\n",
    "- **Professional subsetting** with `.loc[]` for filtering and selection\n",
    "- **Index manipulation** for more efficient data access\n",
    "- **Attributes vs methods** for clean, professional-looking code\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü§î Reflection Questions\n",
    "Take 2-3 minutes to consider:\n",
    "- Which data detective technique will you use first on every new dataset?\n",
    "- When would you choose a Series vs DataFrame for your analysis?\n",
    "- How does using `.loc[]` make your code more professional?\n",

    "### üîó Connection to Course Goals\n",
    "These foundational skills in systematic data exploration and professional subsetting techniques will be essential for every analysis you do in this course and your career. You now have the tools to confidently approach any dataset and extract the insights that matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìã Next Steps\n",
    "- **Before next Tuesday:** Read Chapters 7-9 to reinforce today's concepts\n",
    "- **Next Tuesday:** Data manipulation and aggregation techniques\n",
    "- **Additional Practice:** Try applying these detective techniques to other datasets\n",

    "**Issue 1:** `KeyError` when accessing columns\n",
    "- **Solution:** Check exact column names using `df.columns` - they're case-sensitive!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 2:** Forgetting parentheses on methods\n",
    "- **Solution:** Remember: Methods = Actions = Parentheses. `df.head()` not `df.head`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 3:** Using `and`/`or` instead of `&`/`|` in pandas conditions\n",
    "- **Solution:** Always use `&` (and) and `|` (or) with pandas, and wrap conditions in parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 4:** Confusing Series vs DataFrame outputs\n",
    "- **Solution:** Use `type()` to check what you're working with. Use `[[]]` to keep DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Debugging Tips:**\n",
    "- Use `.shape` to verify your filtering worked as expected\n",
    "- Use `.head()` to preview results before running complex operations\n",
    "- Break complex conditions into separate variables for easier debugging"
