    "# TA Guidance: Week 4 Lab ‚Äì Data Wrangling - From Business Question to Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Lab Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration**: 75 minutes  \n",
    "**Focus**: Data manipulation, aggregation, and joining with business context  \n",
    "**Key Skills**: pandas operations, business analysis, data wrangling workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, students will be able to:\n",
    "1. **Apply data manipulation techniques** to answer real business questions\n",
    "2. **Perform joins and aggregations** to combine datasets for analysis\n",
    "3. **Translate business requirements** into analytical code\n",
    "4. **Work systematically** through complex data analysis workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Course Content\n",
    "- **Tuesday Slides**: Data manipulation, joining, aggregation concepts\n",
    "- **Readings 10-12**: Manipulating Data, Summarizing Data, Joining Data\n",
    "- **Business Focus**: Real-world retail analytics scenarios"

    "## üìö Pre-Lab Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and Technical Considerations\n",
    "- **Data Loading**: Uses `completejourney_py` package - students may need to install\n",
    "- **Common Issues**: \n",
    "  - Package installation problems\n",
    "  - Understanding the business scenario context\n",
    "  - Confusion about join keys (household_key vs household_id)\n",
    "- **Time Management**: This lab has 12+ questions - students will NOT finish all during class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Teaching Points\n",
    "1. **Business Context Matters**: Every analysis serves a real business need\n",
    "2. **Systematic Approach**: Break complex questions into steps\n",
    "3. **Data Quality**: Always check for missing values and data issues\n",
    "4. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build to advanced joins and aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grouping Strategy\n",
    "- **Group Size**: 2-4 students\n",
    "- **Roles**: Consider rotating who \"drives\" the coding\n",
    "- **Pacing**: Allow groups to work at different speeds\n",
    "- **Support**: Provide hints rather than complete solutions during class"

    "\n",
    "1. **Data Manipulation Fundamentals**\n",
    "   - Creating calculated columns (unit_price)\n",
    "   - Date extraction and manipulation\n",
    "   - Handling missing values and data quality issues\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Aggregation and Grouping**\n",
    "   - Single-column groupby operations\n",
    "   - Multiple aggregation functions (sum, mean, count)\n",
    "   - Sorting and ranking results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Joining Datasets**\n",
    "   - Inner joins between transactions, products, and demographics\n",
    "   - Understanding join keys and relationships\n",
    "   - Multi-step analysis workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Business Analysis Skills**\n",
    "   - Translating business questions into analytical code\n",
    "   - Interpreting results in business context\n",
    "   - Understanding retail analytics applications\n",

    "\n",
    "| Issue | Symptom | Solution Approach |\n",
    "|-------|---------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Join Key Confusion** | Errors joining demographics | Emphasize household_key vs household_id |\n",
    "| **Data Type Issues** | kid_count comparisons fail | Show string vs numeric data handling |\n",
    "| **Missing Values** | Division by zero errors | Demonstrate data quality checks |\n",
    "| **Complex Filtering** | Multi-criteria queries fail | Break into steps, explain boolean logic |\n",
    "| **Business Context** | Focus only on code | Emphasize real-world implications |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "Use these to check student understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Technical Skills**: \"Which join operation would you use if you wanted to keep all transactions, even for products not in the products table?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Business Application**: \"How would the operations team actually use the peak sales day analysis in practice?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Quality**: \"What other data quality issues might affect retail analytics?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Strategic Thinking**: \"If you were the vendor management team, what additional analyses would you want?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Homework and Future Content\n",
    "- **Homework Quiz**: Students use their analysis results to answer quiz questions\n",
    "- **Next Week**: Building on joins and aggregations for more complex visualizations\n",
    "- **Mid-term Project**: These retail analytics skills directly apply to the project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "**If students finish early:**\n",
    "- Explore additional business questions\n",
    "- Calculate profitability metrics\n",
    "- Analyze seasonal trends\n",
    "- Help struggling classmates\n",
    "\n",
    "**If students struggle with concepts:**\n",
    "- Break complex questions into smaller steps\n",
    "- Use business analogies to explain technical concepts\n",
    "- Provide additional guided examples\n",
    "- Focus on understanding over completion\n",
    "\n",
    "**If technology issues arise:**\n",
    "- Have backup datasets ready\n",
    "- Know common import/installation fixes\n",
    "- Pair students for screen sharing\n",
    "- Prepare offline alternatives\n",
