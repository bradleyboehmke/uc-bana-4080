    "# Week 12 Lab: The Professional ML Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/bradleyboehmke/uc-bana-4080/blob/main/labs/12_wk12_lab.ipynb\" target=\"_parent\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"/></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 12! This week marks a turning point in your data science journey. Up until now, you've been learning the fundamentals of building machine learning models—and you've done great work. But this week, you're leveling up from \"beginner data scientist\" to \"production-ready professional.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the uncomfortable truth: **we've been breaking a fundamental rule of production machine learning**. Every time you compared different model settings or tuned hyperparameters based on test set performance, you were \"peeking\" at the test set—making your performance estimates less trustworthy. This week, you'll learn the **proper workflow** that ensures honest, reliable model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll practice three critical professional skills: **cross-validation** (comparing models without contaminating your test set), **hyperparameter tuning** (systematically finding optimal model configurations), and **feature engineering** (transforming raw data into powerful model inputs). By the end, you'll be able to build models the right way—with techniques that work in production, not just in the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Implement k-fold cross-validation to compare models without touching the test set\n",
    "- Use GridSearchCV to systematically tune hyperparameters across multiple parameters\n",
    "- Apply feature engineering techniques including encoding, scaling, and creating new features\n",
    "- Build end-to-end pipelines that prevent data leakage and ensure reproducible workflows\n",
    "- Execute the complete 5-stage professional ML workflow from data preparation through final evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 This Lab Reinforces\n",
    "- **Chapter 28: Cross-Validation** — K-fold CV, test set contamination, the proper 5-stage workflow\n",
    "- **Chapter 29: Hyperparameter Tuning** — Bias-variance tradeoff, GridSearchCV, systematic parameter search\n",
    "- **Chapter 30: Feature Engineering** — Encoding strategies, feature scaling, pipelines, preventing data leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🕐 Estimated Time & Structure\n",
    "**Total Time:** 75 minutes  \n",
    "**Mode:** Group work (2-4 students)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[0–30 min]** Part A: Guided Reinforcement — TA-led practice with cross-validation, GridSearchCV, and feature engineering\n",
    "- **[30–40 min]** Class Q&A — Discussion and clarification of key concepts\n",
    "- **[40–72 min]** Part B: Independent Challenges — 6 group challenges applying the complete professional workflow\n",
    "- **[72–75 min]** Wrap-Up & Reflection — What you learned and next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to work in small groups of **2–4 students** and complete the lab together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Why This Matters\n",
    "These are the skills that separate junior data scientists from professionals who build production-ready models. When you interview for data science positions, employers will ask about cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering—they want to know you can build models that perform reliably in the real world, not just on classroom exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, these techniques ensure your models are trustworthy. When you tell a business stakeholder \"this model will achieve 85% accuracy in production,\" you need to be confident that estimate is honest and reliable. The professional workflow you'll practice today is what makes that confidence possible."

    "When building machine learning models, it's critical to apply all preprocessing steps (like scaling and encoding) in a reproducible, leak-proof way. Scikit-learn's `Pipeline` lets you chain together feature engineering and modeling steps so that each transformation is fit only on the training data within each cross-validation fold. This minimizes data leakage and ensures your workflow is robust and production-ready.\n",

    "## 🚨 Troubleshooting & Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 1: GridSearchCV is taking forever to run**\n",
    "- **Solution:** Reduce the size of your parameter grid during experimentation. Instead of `[1, 10, 100, 1000]`, try `[10, 100]` first. You can also reduce `cv` from 5 to 3 for faster prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 2: \"ValueError: Input contains NaN\"**\n",
    "- **Solution:** Some features in the Ames dataset have missing values. Either drop rows with missing values using `.dropna()`, or impute missing values using `SimpleImputer` from sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 3: One-hot encoding creates too many columns**\n",
    "- **Solution:** This is normal for features with many categories (like Neighborhood). You can: (1) use only high-frequency categories, (2) use label encoding for tree-based models instead, or (3) accept the high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 4: \"Arrays must have the same shape\" when predicting on test set**\n",
    "- **Solution:** Make sure you apply the same transformations to both train and test sets. If you used `pd.get_dummies()` on the train set, you need to apply it to the test set too, ensuring the same columns exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 5: Pipeline syntax is confusing**\n",
    "- **Solution:** Remember the double underscore notation: `'step_name__parameter_name'`. To tune a Ridge model in a pipeline, use `'model__alpha'` where 'model' is the name you gave that pipeline step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 6: CV scores vary dramatically between folds**\n",
    "- **Solution:** High variance in CV scores suggests your model is unstable or you have outliers. Try: (1) increasing training data, (2) simplifying your model, (3) checking for data quality issues, or (4) using stratified splits if appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Debugging Tips:**\n",
    "- Print the shape of your data at each step to catch dimension mismatches early\n",
    "- Start simple (fewer features, simpler models) and add complexity gradually\n",
    "- Use `verbose=1` in GridSearchCV to see progress\n",
    "- Check for missing values with `df.isnull().sum()`\n",
    "- When encoding categorical variables, verify the columns match between train and test sets"
