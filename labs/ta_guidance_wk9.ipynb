    "# TA Guidance: Week 9 Lab - Correlation & Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Lab Overview and Teaching Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Understanding:** This lab serves as **BOTH** the in-class Thursday lab **AND** the weekly homework assignment. Students will use their numerical results from the three challenges to complete the Canvas quiz due Sunday.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Students will calculate and interpret correlation coefficients for business relationships\n",
    "- Students will build and evaluate simple and multiple linear regression models using scikit-learn\n",
    "- Students will apply proper train/test split methodology for honest model evaluation\n",
    "- Students will interpret regression coefficients and evaluation metrics in business contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Allocation & Teaching Strategy\n",
    "- **Part 1 & 2 (30-40 minutes)**: TA-guided instruction and demonstrations\n",
    "- **Part 3 (35-40 minutes)**: **Independent group work** - Students complete challenges as homework\n",
    "- **Wrap-up (5 minutes)**: Brief summary and Canvas quiz reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Alignment\n",
    "- Directly reinforces Tuesday's slides on correlation analysis and regression modeling\n",
    "- Provides hands-on practice with all key concepts from Chapters 21-22\n",
    "- Uses the same datasets as textbook end-of-chapter exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ†Ô∏è Pre-Lab Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Setup:**\n",
    "- Ensure all students can access Google Colab and load the lab notebook\n",
    "- Test that ISLP package loads correctly (if issues arise, provide CSV fallback files)\n",
    "- Have backup plan for internet connectivity issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grouping Strategy:**\n",
    "- Form groups of 2-4 students before starting\n",
    "- Mix students with different programming experience levels\n",
    "- Encourage collaboration during challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Materials Needed:**\n",
    "- Lab notebook: `09_wk9_lab.ipynb`\n",
    "- This TA guidance notebook\n",
    "- Access to course datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìö Key Concepts to Emphasize\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation vs Causation**: Constantly remind students that correlation measures association, not causation\n",
    "2. **Business Interpretation**: Every coefficient and metric should be explained in business terms\n",
    "3. **Train/Test Split**: This is the most important concept - models must be evaluated on unseen data\n",
    "4. **Homework Integration**: Challenge results directly feed into Canvas quiz answers"

    "## Part 1 & 2 Teaching Guide: Guided Instruction (30-40 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Teaching Approach for Parts 1 & 2\n",
    "- **Walk through systematically**: Students should follow along and execute code\n",
    "- **Explain business context**: Connect every concept to real-world applications\n",
    "- **Encourage questions**: This is the time for clarification before independent work\n",
    "- **Demonstrate best practices**: Model the workflow students will use in challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Teaching Points:\n",
    "- **Start with business context**: \"Marketing managers need to know which advertising channels work best\"\n",
    "- **Emphasize interpretation**: What does correlation of 0.78 vs 0.23 mean for strategy?\n",
    "- **Visual reinforcement**: Scatterplots help students internalize correlation strength\n",
    "- **Model building workflow**: Always start with feature matrix X and target vector y\n",
    "- **Train/test importance**: \"Would you trust a model that was only tested on the data it learned from?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Student Questions & Responses:\n",
    "- **Q: \"Why is newspaper correlation so low?\"**\n",
    "  - A: \"This suggests newspaper advertising might be less effective, but remember - correlation doesn't prove causation.\"\n",
    "- **Q: \"What's a 'good' correlation?\"**\n",
    "  - A: \"It depends on the business context. In marketing, 0.7+ is strong, but in financial markets, even 0.3 can be valuable.\"\n",
    "- **Q: Double brackets confusion**\n",
    "  - A: \"For single features, use `[[column]]` to maintain DataFrame structure for scikit-learn\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition to Independent Work\n",
    "After Parts 1 & 2, clearly communicate:\n",
    "- \"Now you'll work independently on challenges that serve as your homework\"\n",
    "- \"Record your numerical results carefully - you'll need them for the Canvas quiz\"\n",
    "- \"I'll circulate to help, but you need to work through the problems yourselves\""

    "## Part 3 Teaching Strategy: Independent Challenge Work (35-40 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üö® Critical Teaching Philosophy for Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**DO NOT walk through the challenges step-by-step.** This is their homework, and they need to work through it independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Role During Challenges:\n",
    "1. **Circulate and support**: Walk around the room, check in with groups\n",
    "2. **Answer specific questions**: Help with syntax errors, conceptual clarifications\n",
    "3. **Provide strategic hints**: Guide thinking without giving away answers\n",
    "4. **Demonstrate techniques**: If many groups struggle with the same concept, show it briefly\n",
    "5. **Encourage collaboration**: Groups should work together and learn from each other\n",
    "\n",
    "### What NOT to Do:\n",
    "- ‚ùå **Don't solve entire challenges for them**\n",
    "- ‚ùå **Don't provide complete code solutions**\n",
    "- ‚ùå **Don't walk through every step systematically**\n",
    "- ‚ùå **Don't give away numerical answers they need for the quiz**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Support Approaches:\n",
    "- **For struggling groups**: \"What specific part are you stuck on?\" then provide targeted help\n",
    "- **For syntax issues**: Show the correct syntax pattern, let them apply it\n",
    "- **For conceptual confusion**: Ask guiding questions to help them think through the problem\n",
    "- **For interpretation questions**: \"What do you think this number means in business terms?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Management:\n",
    "- **Challenge 1**: Allow 12 minutes, then briefly check progress\n",
    "- **Challenge 2**: Allow 12 minutes, provide hints if many groups are stuck\n",
    "- **Challenge 3**: Allow 11 minutes, may extend if needed\n",
    "- **Final 5-10 minutes**: Address common issues, Canvas quiz reminders"

    "## üéØ Wrap-Up Guidance (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Emphasize:\n",
    "1. **Homework Connection**: \"The challenges you just worked on ARE your homework this week\"\n",
    "2. **Canvas Quiz**: \"Use your numerical results for the Canvas quiz due Sunday\"\n",
    "3. **Real-world relevance**: \"These techniques are used daily in business analytics\"\n",
    "4. **Process importance**: \"The train/test split workflow is crucial for any ML project\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Canvas Quiz Reminders:\n",
    "- Students need their specific numerical results from each challenge\n",
    "- Emphasize the importance of using exact parameters specified (random_state values)\n",
    "- Quiz will include matching, multiple choice, and fill-in-the-blank questions\n",
    "- Due Sunday before class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preview Next Week:\n",
    "- \"Next Tuesday we'll explore classification models - predicting categorical outcomes\"\n",
    "- \"We'll learn to predict things like spam vs not spam, click vs not click\"\n",
    "- \"The evaluation principles you learned today apply to all machine learning models\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## üö® Common Issues & Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Issues:\n",
    "1. **ISLP package not loading**: Provide CSV backup files\n",
    "2. **Random state confusion**: Emphasize that different random states give different results\n",
    "3. **Dummy encoding errors**: Remind about `drop_first=True`\n",
    "4. **Coefficient rounding**: Each challenge has different rounding requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Issues:\n",
    "1. **Correlation vs causation**: Keep reinforcing this distinction\n",
    "2. **Overfitting confusion**: Use simple analogies (memorizing vs understanding)\n",
    "3. **Coefficient interpretation**: Always bring back to business context\n",
    "4. **Train/test split importance**: \"Never trust a model evaluated on its training data\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Management:\n",
    "- If behind schedule: Focus on Challenge 1 and 2, Challenge 3 can be completed outside class\n",
    "- If ahead of schedule: Encourage deeper business interpretation discussions\n",
    "- Always preserve time for Canvas quiz reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìã Post-Lab Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "**For TAs:**\n",
    "- [ ] All groups attempted at least Challenges 1-2\n",
    "- [ ] Students understand this is their homework\n",
    "- [ ] Canvas quiz parameters clearly communicated\n",
    "- [ ] Students know results are due Sunday\n",
    "- [ ] Note any concepts that need reinforcement next week\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Students:**\n",
    "- [ ] Have attempted all three challenges\n",
    "- [ ] Understand business interpretation of regression coefficients\n",
    "- [ ] Can explain why train/test splits matter\n",
    "- [ ] Know their numerical results will be used for Canvas quiz\n",
    "- [ ] Understand homework is due Sunday\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lab Success Metrics:**\n",
    "- Students can work independently on regression problems\n",
    "- Students can interpret results in business terms\n",
    "- Students understand the homework-lab integration\n",
    "- Students are prepared for the Canvas quiz on Sunday"
