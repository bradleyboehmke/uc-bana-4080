    "# TA Guidance: Week 5 Lab - From Aggregation to Visualization & Midterm Prep\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lab Duration:** 75 minutes total\n",
    "**Class:** BANA 4080 - Introduction to Data Mining with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Quick Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab has three distinct phases:\n",
    "1. **Part 1 (10-15 min):** TA-led demo of visualization techniques\n",
    "2. **Part 2 (20-30 min):** Student group work on visualization challenges + presentations\n",
    "3. **Part 3 (30-40 min):** Midterm project exploration and brainstorming\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, students should be able to:\n",
    "- Create effective visualizations using pandas, matplotlib, and bokeh\n",
    "- Transform aggregated data into clear business insights through visualization\n",
    "- Navigate the completejourney_py dataset for exploratory analysis\n",
    "- Formulate potential business questions for their midterm projects\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Pre-Lab Preparation (TA Review - 15-20 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Reading\n",
    "- **Review the midterm project description and rubric thoroughly** - you'll be guiding students through project brainstorming\n",
    "- **Test all code examples** in Part 1 to ensure smooth demonstration\n",
    "- **Review solutions** for Part 2 challenges (provided below)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Chapter Knowledge\n",
    "This lab assumes the TA has fully reviewed and is familiar with the concepts covered in:\n",
    "- **Chapter 13**: [Data Visualization with Pandas](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/uc-bana-4080/13-data-viz-pandas.html)\n",
    "- **Chapter 14**: [Data Visualization with Matplotlib](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/uc-bana-4080/14-data-viz-matplotlib.html)\n",
    "- **Chapter 15**: [Data Visualization with Bokeh](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/uc-bana-4080/15-data-viz-bokeh.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "These chapters provide the foundational knowledge for all visualization techniques demonstrated in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts to Emphasize\n",
    "- **Business storytelling with data**: Every visualization should answer a specific business question\n",
    "- **Tool selection**: When to use pandas vs matplotlib vs bokeh\n",
    "- **Data joining strategies**: Critical for both lab challenges and midterm projects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Student Challenges\n",
    "- Difficulty choosing appropriate visualization types\n",
    "- Confusion about joining multiple datasets\n",
    "- Overwhelming scope when starting midterm project brainstorming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and Technology\n",
    "- Ensure all students can access Google Colab\n",
    "- Test `completejourney_py` package installation\n",
    "- Have backup datasets ready if package installation fails\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: TA-Led Demo (10-15 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing Breakdown\n",
    "- **Setup and intro** (2-3 min)\n",
    "- **Demo 1A: Pandas bar chart** (3-4 min)\n",
    "- **Demo 1B: Matplotlib line chart** (3-4 min)\n",
    "- **Demo 1C: Bokeh interactive chart** (4-5 min)\n",
    "- **Tool comparison wrap-up** (1-2 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Teaching Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Opening (2-3 min):**\n",
    "- \"Today we're taking the aggregation skills from last week and turning them into compelling visualizations\"\n",
    "- \"We'll use three different tools - each has its strengths for different business scenarios\"\n",
    "- Walk through the three demos quickly, then dive in\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demo 1A: Pandas Plotting (3-4 min)**\n",
    "- **Key message**: \"Pandas is perfect for quick exploratory charts tied directly to your data\"\n",
    "- **Emphasize**: The `.plot()` method works directly on Series and DataFrames\n",
    "- **Business context**: \"This is what you'd show your manager in 5 minutes to answer 'Which categories drive our sales?'\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demo 1B: Matplotlib (3-4 min)**\n",
    "- **Key message**: \"Matplotlib gives you fine-grained control for professional presentations\"\n",
    "- **Emphasize**: The styling options and customization capabilities\n",
    "- **Business context**: \"This is what goes in your quarterly report to executives\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demo 1C: Bokeh (4-5 min)**\n",
    "- **Key message**: \"Bokeh creates interactive visualizations for digital dashboards\"\n",
    "- **Emphasize**: The hover functionality and interactivity\n",
    "- **Business context**: \"This is what you'd embed in a web dashboard for ongoing monitoring\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Questions and Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: \"When should I use each tool?\"**\n",
    "A: \"Pandas for quick exploration, matplotlib for static reports, bokeh for interactive dashboards. Think about your audience and use case.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: \"Why do we need three different tools?\"**\n",
    "A: \"Different business scenarios require different presentation formats. A quick check uses pandas, a board presentation uses matplotlib, a live dashboard uses bokeh.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: \"Can I mix these in one project?\"**\n",
    "A: \"Absolutely! Most real projects use multiple visualization tools depending on the specific analysis and audience.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Student Group Challenges (20-30 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing Strategy\n",
    "- **Challenge work**: 15-20 minutes\n",
    "- **Group presentations**: 8-12 minutes (2-3 groups, 3-4 min each)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facilitation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Starting the Challenge (2-3 min):**\n",
    "- \"You have three business questions to explore through visualization\"\n",
    "- \"Choose at least one, but feel free to tackle more if time allows\"\n",
    "- \"Focus on creating visualizations that clearly answer the business question\"\n",
    "- **Group formation**: 2-4 students per group\n",
    "\n",
    "**During Group Work (15-20 min):**\n",
    "- **Circulate actively** - visit each group at least twice\n",
    "- **Strategic questioning**: \"What story is your visualization telling?\" \"How does this answer the business question?\"\n",
    "- **Technical assistance**: Help with data joining and visualization syntax as needed\n",
    "- **Time management**: Give 10-minute and 5-minute warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Presentation Selection Strategy:**\n",
    "- Look for **diverse approaches** to the same question\n",
    "- Select groups with **clear visualizations** that tell a story\n",
    "- Choose **different business questions** if possible\n",
    "- Consider both **strong solutions** and **interesting approaches** that could lead to good discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group Presentations (8-12 min):**\n",
    "- \"Show us your visualization and explain what business insight it reveals\"\n",
    "- **Time limit**: 3-4 minutes per group maximum\n",
    "- **Encourage discussion**: \"What do others think about this approach?\""

    "\n",
    "**❌ Avoid These:**\n",
    "- \"What does the data show?\" (too broad)\n",
    "- \"Which products sell the most?\" (too descriptive, not growth-focused)\n",
    "- \"How much money does Regork make?\" (not actionable)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Exploration Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start Simple:**\n",
    "1. Look at each dataset individually\n",
    "2. Try basic joins between 2 datasets\n",
    "3. Create simple aggregations\n",
    "4. Look for surprising patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask \"So What?\" Questions:**\n",
    "- \"This pattern is interesting, but how could Regork profit from it?\"\n",
    "- \"If I were the CEO, what would I do with this information?\"\n",
    "- \"What specific action should the company take?\"\n",

    "### Common Student Questions and Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: \"Our question feels too simple\"**\n",
    "A: \"Simple questions with deep analysis are better than complex questions with surface analysis. Focus on thorough investigation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: \"We found something interesting but don't know if it's good for a project\"**\n",
    "A: \"Great! Interesting findings are exactly what we want. Let's think about how Regork could act on this discovery.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: \"Can we use external data?\"**\n",
    "A: \"Stick to completejourney_py for now. There's plenty of rich information in those datasets when you join them creatively.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: \"How technical should our analysis be?\"**\n",
    "A: \"Focus on business insights over technical complexity. A simple analysis with clear recommendations beats a complex analysis with unclear conclusions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red Flags to Watch For\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope Issues:**\n",
    "- Projects trying to answer 5+ business questions\n",
    "- Questions too broad (\"analyze all customers\") or too narrow (\"look at one specific household\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Issues:**\n",
    "- Groups focusing only on descriptive statistics\n",
    "- Not connecting findings to actionable business recommendations\n",
    "- Using only one dataset (project requires meaningful joins)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaboration Issues:**\n",
    "- Groups where one person dominates or others don't participate\n",
    "- Groups that can't agree on a direction\n",

    "### Key Takeaways to Reinforce\n",
    "- **Visualization purpose**: Every chart should answer a specific business question\n",
    "- **Tool selection**: Choose the right tool for your audience and purpose\n",
    "- **Midterm timeline**: Business question approval needed by end of Week 6 lab\n",

    "**completejourney_py installation fails:**\n",
    "- Try `!pip install --upgrade completejourney_py`\n",
    "- Have backup CSV files ready if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bokeh not displaying:**\n",
    "- Ensure `output_notebook()` is called\n",
    "- Try refreshing the browser\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory issues with large datasets:**\n",
    "- Suggest filtering data before complex operations\n",
    "- Use `.head()` for testing code before running on full dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pedagogical Challenges\n",
    "**Students rushing through without understanding:**\n",
    "- Ask \"What business insight does this reveal?\"\n",
    "- Slow down and focus on interpretation over completion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Groups struggling to collaborate:**\n",
    "- Suggest role assignments (data analyst, visualization specialist, business interpreter)\n",
    "- Encourage discussion of different approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overwhelming midterm project scope:**\n",
    "- \"Start with one simple question and go deep rather than broad\"\n",
    "- \"You can always expand later if you finish early\"\n",

    "## Post-Lab Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "After the lab, consider:\n",
    "- Which visualization concepts needed more explanation?\n",
    "- What midterm project questions seem most promising?\n",
    "- Which groups might need extra support moving forward?\n",
    "- Any technical issues to address before next week?\n",
