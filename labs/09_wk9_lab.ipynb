    "In this lab, you'll apply correlation analysis and linear regression to real business datasets, following the complete machine learning workflow from data exploration through model evaluation. You'll work with multiple datasets to understand how businesses use these techniques to drive strategic decisions, predict outcomes, and measure model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Calculate and interpret correlation coefficients for business relationships\n",
    "- Build and evaluate simple and multiple linear regression models using scikit-learn\n",
    "- Apply proper train/test split methodology for honest model evaluation\n",
    "- Interpret regression coefficients and evaluation metrics in business contexts\n",

    "## üí° Why This Matters\n",
    "Regression analysis is one of the most widely used techniques in business analytics. From predicting sales based on advertising spend to understanding factors that drive customer satisfaction, regression provides the foundation for data-driven decision making. This lab will prepare you to build, evaluate, and interpret regression models that businesses actually use to guide strategy and operations."

    "## üö® Troubleshooting & Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 1:** \"ValueError: Input contains NaN values\"\n",
    "- **Solution:** Use `.dropna()` or `.fillna()` to handle missing values before fitting models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 2:** \"X has 1 feature(s) but LinearRegression is expecting X features\"\n",
    "- **Solution:** Make sure to use double brackets `[[column]]` for single features or ensure consistent feature selection between training and prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 3:** Dummy encoding not working properly\n",
    "- **Solution:** Use `pd.get_dummies(data, drop_first=True)` to avoid multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue 4:** \"RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in matmul\" in Challenge 3\n",
    "- **Problem:** Applying `pd.get_dummies()` to both numeric and categorical columns together\n",
    "- **Solution:** Only apply dummy encoding to categorical variables. For Challenge 3, use:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Correct approach: separate numeric and categorical processing\n",
    "  college_encoded = pd.concat([\n",
    "      college[['Top10perc', 'Outstate']], \n",
    "      pd.get_dummies(college[['Private']], drop_first=True)\n",
    "  ], axis=1)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Debugging Tips:**\n",
    "- Always check data shapes with `.shape` before fitting models\n",
    "- Print intermediate results to verify your data transformations\n",
    "- Use the same random_state value specified in challenges for reproducible results"
