    "## Group Formation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal Team Composition\n",
    "- **Mixed experience levels** - avoid all strong or all struggling students in one group\n",
    "- **Diverse perspectives** - different majors/backgrounds when possible\n",
    "- **4 students per group** - fewer than 4 reduces collaboration, more than 4 reduces participation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Methods\n",
    "1. **Random assignment** (fastest, usually works well)\n",
    "2. **Strategic assignment** (if you know students well)\n",
    "3. **Self-selection with constraints** (\"no more than 2 from same major\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role Assignment\n",
    "Each team should designate:\n",
    "- **Problem Framer** (Slide 1) - often good for detail-oriented students\n",
    "- **Data Strategist** (Slide 2) - good for technically strong students\n",
    "- **Risk Analyst** (Slide 3) - good for critical thinkers\n",
    "- **Ethics Officer** (Slide 4) - good for students interested in business/policy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Group Dynamics\n",
    "- **Watch for dominating members** - encourage equal participation\n",
    "- **Support quiet students** - private encouragement often helps\n",
    "- **Address conflicts quickly** - usually stem from misunderstanding requirements\n",
    "- **Be willing to redistribute** if group chemistry is poor"

    "### Setting Up for Success\n",
    "- **Volunteer solicitation:** Start asking for volunteers at 50-minute mark\n",
    "- **Backup plan:** Have random selection method ready\n",
    "- **Technical setup:** Test screen sharing and presentation tools\n",
    "- **Time management:** Use visible timer, give 30-second warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "### During Presentations\n",
    "- **Encourage the audience:** \"What questions do you have for this team?\"\n",
    "- **Ask follow-up questions:** Test understanding beyond their slides\n",
    "- **Point out good insights:** \"That's a great observation about...\"\n",
    "- **Connect to course concepts:** \"How does this relate to what we learned on Tuesday?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good Follow-up Questions\n",
    "- \"What would happen if your model was wrong in this case?\"\n",
    "- \"How would you convince a skeptical stakeholder this approach is right?\"\n",
    "- \"What would you do differently if you had unlimited time and budget?\"\n",
    "- \"Which assumption are you most worried about?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Difficult Situations\n",
    "- **Unprepared groups:** Ask easier questions, focus on learning points\n",
    "- **Overly confident groups:** Push on edge cases and assumptions\n",
    "- **Technical difficulties:** Have backup presentation methods ready\n",
    "- **Time overruns:** Politely interrupt and summarize key points\n",

    "\n",
    "### Extra Credit Guidelines\n",
    "- **5 points** for volunteering to present\n",
    "- **Applied to:** This lab grade or overall participation grade\n",
    "- **Criteria:** Volunteering is sufficient; presentation quality doesn't affect points\n",
    "- **Record keeping:** Track which students presented for grade book\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation Evaluation\n",
    "While extra credit is just for volunteering, use these criteria for feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excellent (A-level):**\n",
    "- Specific, actionable problem framing\n",
    "- Thoughtful train/test strategy with clear justification\n",
    "- Multiple concrete leakage risks identified\n",
    "- Specific fairness/privacy concerns with mitigation strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good (B-level):**\n",
    "- Clear problem statement with some specificity\n",
    "- Reasonable data strategy with basic justification\n",
    "- Some leakage risks identified\n",
    "- General ethical considerations addressed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Needs Improvement (C-level):**\n",
    "- Vague problem framing\n",
    "- Generic data strategy without justification\n",
    "- Minimal attention to leakage or ethics\n",
    "- Focus on algorithms rather than planning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework Connection\n",
    "Remind students that their presentations will be submitted as homework:\n",
    "- **Format:** PowerPoint or Google Slides\n",
    "- **Due date:** Standard homework deadline\n",
    "- **Grading:** More detailed rubric for homework submission\n",
    "- **Improvement opportunity:** Can revise based on class feedback"

    "### Common Adjustments for Future\n",
    "- **More time for group work** if teams struggled with presentations\n",

    "- **No internet:** Have offline versions of scenarios printed\n",
    "- **Presentation issues:** Use flip chart paper for slide content\n",
    "- **Small groups:** Combine scenarios or do fishbowl discussions\n",
    "- **No projector:** Have teams present to each other in corners\n",

    "### Time Constraints\n",
    "- **Behind schedule:** Focus on slides 1-2, discuss 3-4 in groups\n",

    "- **No presentations:** Do gallery walk with poster presentations\n",

    "### Last Resort Options\n",
    "If the full lab format doesn't work:\n",
    "1. **Modified workshop:** Work through one scenario as full class\n",
    "2. **Case study analysis:** Deep dive on StreamFlix example from Tuesday\n",
    "3. **Concept practice:** Structured Q&A on readings with examples\n",
    "4. **Planning templates:** Have students fill out structured planning worksheets"
