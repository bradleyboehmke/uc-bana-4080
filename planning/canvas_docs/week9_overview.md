# Module 9 Overview: Correlation & Regression Analysis

## Module Topic

This week introduces you to the powerful world of predictive modeling through correlation analysis and linear regression. You'll learn to move beyond describing individual variables to understanding how variables relate to and influence each other. These techniques form the foundation of data-driven business decision-making, allowing you to quantify relationships, make predictions, and evaluate model performance.

We'll explore how businesses use correlation to identify relationships between variables like marketing spend and sales, then advance to linear regression for making concrete predictions. You'll master both simple regression (one predictor) and multiple regression (several predictors), while learning to evaluate model performance using metrics that matter for business decisions.

**Important:** This week's lab will also serve as your homework assignment. The hands-on challenges you complete in lab will prepare you for the Canvas quiz due Sunday.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain what correlation measures and interpret correlation coefficients in business contexts
- Distinguish between correlation and causation when making business recommendations
- Build and interpret simple linear regression models using scikit-learn
- Extend regression models to include multiple numeric and categorical predictors
- Convert categorical variables using dummy encoding for regression analysis
- Calculate and interpret key evaluation metrics (R¬≤, RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
- Apply train/test split methodology for honest model evaluation
- Recognize overfitting vs underfitting and assess model generalization
- Connect regression coefficients to actionable business insights
- Make predictions for new scenarios using fitted models

## ‚úÖ What You'll Learn This Week

**Correlation Analysis for Business Relationships:**
- Measuring the strength and direction of linear relationships between variables
- Calculating correlation coefficients and interpreting values from -1 to +1
- Understanding when correlation suggests strong vs weak business relationships
- Visualizing relationships through scatterplots and correlation matrices
- Recognizing the critical distinction between correlation and causation

**Linear Regression for Prediction:**
- Building simple regression models with one predictor variable
- Interpreting intercepts and coefficients in business terms
- Extending to multiple regression with several predictors simultaneously
- Handling categorical variables through dummy encoding techniques
- Understanding how regression finds the "best-fit line" by minimizing errors

**Model Evaluation for Business Decisions:**
- Calculating R¬≤ to measure proportion of variation explained by models
- Using RMSE and MAE for interpretable error metrics in business units
- Applying MAPE for scale-independent performance comparisons
- Implementing train/test splits to simulate real-world model deployment
- Diagnosing overfitting vs underfitting through performance comparisons

## üõ†Ô∏è How You'll Practice

**Interactive Code Examples:**
- Following along with business-focused examples during the Tuesday lecture covering advertising effectiveness, sales forecasting, and relationship analysis

**Hands-On Correlation Analysis:**
- Calculating correlation coefficients for real business datasets
- Creating visualizations to explore relationships between key business variables
- Interpreting correlation strength and direction for strategic decision-making

**Regression Modeling Practice:**
- Building simple regression models to predict business outcomes

- Working with categorical predictors using dummy encoding techniques
- Making predictions for new business scenarios and strategic planning

**Model Evaluation and Validation:**
- Implementing proper train/test split methodology for honest evaluation
- Calculating and interpreting multiple evaluation metrics

## Canvas Announcement

Hi everyone,

Hope you're having a great week and are ready to dive into some exciting new analytical territory! In Week 9, we're moving into one of the most powerful and practical areas of data science: understanding relationships between variables and making predictions. You'll learn techniques that businesses use every day to drive strategic decisions and forecast future outcomes.

Here's what you'll be learning:

How to measure and interpret relationships between business variables using correlation analysis

How to build linear regression models that can predict outcomes like sales, customer behavior, and business performance

How to properly evaluate model performance to ensure your predictions are reliable and trustworthy

How to apply these techniques to real business scenarios involving credit risk, salary negotiations, and strategic planning

These skills will transform how you approach business problems‚Äîmoving from describing what happened to predicting what will happen and understanding what drives business outcomes.

üìå Get Started: Jump into Module 9 on Canvas to begin this week's lessons and activities.

**Important Note:** This week's lab will also serve as your homework assignment. During Thursday's lab, you'll work through hands-on challenges with real datasets, and your results will be used for the Canvas quiz due Sunday. Come prepared to dive deep into regression analysis!

As always, don't hesitate to reach out or post in the forums if you get stuck.

Cheers,
Brad
