# Module 6 Overview: Control Flow, Iteration, and Functions

## Module Topic

This week marks a pivotal transition in your Python journey‚Äîfrom working with data to creating intelligent, automated programs. You'll learn how to teach your code to make decisions, repeat tasks efficiently, and organize logic into reusable functions. These fundamental programming concepts will transform you from someone who writes scripts into someone who builds robust data science tools.

We'll explore conditional statements that mirror business decision-making, iteration patterns that automate repetitive tasks, and function design that makes your code professional and maintainable. By week's end, you'll be writing sophisticated programs that can handle complex business logic automatically.

**Important:** This week also includes dedicated time for your mid-term project work. Use the lab session to apply these programming concepts while collaborating with your team on real business analytics challenges.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to create business logic and decision-making in your code
- Use iteration statements (`for`, `while`) to automate repetitive data processing tasks
- Apply `break` and `continue` to control loop execution flow
- Create and utilize list comprehensions for efficient data transformations
- Define custom functions with parameters, default arguments, and type hints
- Write professional function documentation using docstrings
- Implement error handling and validation in your functions
- Understand Python's variable scoping rules (LEGB)
- Apply lambda functions for concise data transformations

## ‚úÖ What You'll Learn This Week

**Control Statements for Business Logic:**
- Simple `if` statements for basic decision-making (inventory alerts, VIP pricing)
- Multi-way branching with `if/elif/else` for complex business rules (customer segmentation)
- Dictionary-based logic as Pythonic alternatives to switch statements
- Vectorized conditionals in pandas for efficient data processing

**Iteration for Business Automation:**
- `for` loops to process multiple datasets, calculate metrics across categories, and automate reporting
- `while` loops for monitoring thresholds and conditional processing scenarios
- List comprehensions for clean, efficient data transformations
- Best practices: when to use loops vs. pandas vectorized operations

**Functions for Professional Code:**
- Function definition syntax and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Parameter types: positional, keyword, default arguments, and `*args`/`**kwargs`
- Type hints and comprehensive docstrings for team collaboration
- Error handling techniques including validation, assertions, and try/except blocks
- Anonymous (lambda) functions for quick transformations in pandas operations

## üõ†Ô∏è How You'll Practice

**Interactive Code Examples:**
- Following along with business-focused examples during the lecture covering real scenarios like customer segmentation, inventory management, and sales commission calculations

**Programming Concepts Application:**
- Writing conditional logic to classify transactions and customer segments
- Building loops to process multiple store locations and time periods
- Creating functions to calculate business metrics like Customer Lifetime Value and ROI

**Mid-term Project Development:**
- Applying these programming concepts in your team's analytical project
- Using functions to organize your data cleaning and analysis pipeline
- Implementing conditional logic for business rules and insights

**Hands-on Lab Work:**
- Dedicated lab time for mid-term project collaboration and development
- Working with team members to combine datasets and develop analytical approaches
- Getting instructor support for both programming concepts and project questions
