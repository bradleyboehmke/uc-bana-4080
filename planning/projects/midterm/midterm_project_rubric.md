# Mid-term Project Rubric

**Total Points: 75**

## Report Components (40 points)

### Report: Introduction (5 points)

**Criteria:**
- (i) Provide an introduction that explains the business problem you are addressing. Why should the Regork CEO be interested in this?
- (ii) Provide a short explanation of how you addressed this problem statement (the data used and the analytic methodology employed)
- (iii) Explain how your analysis will help the Regork CEO (or your manager). What is your proposed solution?

| Rating | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Full Marks** | 5 pts | Report addresses all criteria and provides a clear introduction to the group's analysis |
| **Partial Points** | 3 pts | Report does not address all criteria or does not provide the reader a clear picture of what the report is about |
| **No Marks** | 0 pts | Report does not address any criteria and leaves the reader unclear of what the report is about |

### Report: Packages/Libraries Required (5 points)

**Criteria:**
- (i) All packages/libraries used are imported upfront so the reader knows which are required to replicate the analysis
- (ii) Messages and warnings resulting from loading the packages are suppressed
- (iii) Explanation is provided regarding the purpose of unique packages. There are over 10,000 packages so don't assume that the reader knows why you loaded some esoteric package

| Rating | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Full Marks** | 5 pts | Report addresses all criteria. It's very clear what all libraries are used and why. There are no warnings populated throughout the report |
| **Partial Points** | 3 pts | Some libraries are loaded up front while others are loaded throughout the analysis. Unique libraries are being used without clear explanation of what they are doing |
| **No Marks** | 0 pts | Report does not address any criteria |

### Report: Exploratory Data Analysis (10 points)

**Criteria:**
- (i) Uncover new information in the data that is not self-evident (i.e. do not just plot the data as it is; rather, slice and dice the data in different ways, create new variables, or join separate data frames to create new summary information)
- (ii) Provide findings in the form of plots and tables. Show me you can display findings in different ways
- (iii) Graph(s) are carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one primary point and is appropriately formatted (plot and axis titles, legend if necessary, scales are appropriate, appropriate geoms used, etc.)
- (iv) Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features. Size of table is appropriate
- (v) Insights obtained from the analysis are thoroughly, yet succinctly, explained. Easy to see and understand the interesting findings that you uncovered

| Rating | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Full Marks** | 10 pts | Report addresses all criteria and demonstrates a thorough understanding of exploratory data analysis. Uncovers and explains clear patterns in the data. The report is well-designed and the information presented in the report is clearly explained |
| **Partial Points** | 5 pts | Report addresses most criteria and demonstrates cursory understanding of exploratory data analysis. Uncovers and explains some patterns in the data but explanations are not entirely clear or accurate. Display of graphs and tables are acceptable but could be improved |
| **No Marks** | 0 pts | Report does not address any criteria and does not demonstrate any understanding of exploratory data analysis. Does not uncover nor explain any patterns in the data. Plots and tables are poorly-designed and the information presented in the report is messy and unclear |

### Report: Summary (5 points)

**Criteria:**
- (i) Summarize the problem statement you addressed
- (ii) Summarize how you addressed this problem statement (the data used and the methodology employed)
- (iii) Summarize the interesting insights that your analysis provided
- (iv) Summarize the implications to the consumer of your analysis. What would you propose to the Regork CEO?
- (v) Discuss the limitations of your analysis and how you, or someone else, could improve or build on it

| Rating | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Full Marks** | 5 pts | Report addresses all criteria and provides a clear summary to the group's analysis |
| **Partial Points** | 3 pts | Report does not address all criteria or does not provide the reader a clear picture of what the analysis was about |
| **No Marks** | 0 pts | Report does not address any criteria and leaves the reader unclear of what the analysis was about |

### Report: Formatting & Other Requirements (15 points)

**Criteria:**
- (i) Proper coding style is followed and code is well commented (see section regarding style)
- (ii) Coding is systematic - complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, dictionary, DataFrame, etc). Code checks for common errors
- (iii) Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity: Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps, somewhat creatively. Perhaps student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course
- (iv) .ipynb fully executes without any errors and output produced matches the HTML report submitted by student

| Rating | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Full Marks** | 15 pts | Report addresses all criteria and is well-designed and the information presented in the report is clearly explained. The group showed mastery of the course content through their analysis |
| **Partial Points** | 8 pts | Report is acceptable and addresses most of the criteria. The group shows basic understanding of the course content through their analysis but did not show signs of mastery, cleverness, or creative application |
| **No Marks** | 0 pts | Report does not address any criteria and is poorly-designed and the information presented in the report is messy and unclear. The group did not show that they grasp basic concepts and code applications from the course |

## Presentation Components (35 points)

### Presentation: Introduction (5 points)

| **Partial Points** | 3 pts | Presentation does not address all criteria or does not provide the reader a clear picture of what the analysis was about. Or maybe they do but do not provide a clear recommendation for the decision maker |
| **No Marks** | 0 pts | Presentation does not address any criteria and leaves the reader unclear of what the analysis was about nor is there a clear recommendation for the decision maker |

### Presentation: Formatting & Other Requirements (15 points)
