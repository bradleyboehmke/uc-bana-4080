# Week 2 Lab  {background="#43464B"}

## 🧪 Practicing the Fundamentals {.smaller}

This week’s lab is all about **getting comfortable** with the tools and techniques we introduced on Tuesday.

**What You'll Be Doing Today**

- ✅ **Work inside Jupyter Notebooks**  
  Get hands-on with markdown, cell execution, and documenting code

- 🧠 **Explore Python Data Structures**  
  Practice with lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets

- 🛠️ **Use Libraries**  
  Learn how to work with built-in tools and explore third-party packages

::: {.callout-note}
👥 You can work in small groups of 2–4 students.  

We'll give short instructions, then let you dive in!

# Jupyter Notebooks  {background="#43464B"}

## 📓 Quick Review: Jupyter Notebooks {.smaller}

- Run code **cell-by-cell**  
  ➕ Great for experimenting, debugging, and explaining your thought process

- Use **Markdown cells** to:
  - Add headings, paragraphs, bullet points
  - Write math equations with LaTeX (`$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$`)
  - Embed images, tables, and even videos

- Output is **saved right below** the code — making it great for storytelling and reporting

## In This Class…

We’ll use Jupyter for writing and testing Python code, documenting our analysis and creating clean, readable project reports.

## ✍️ Lab Activity: Build Your Bio {.smaller}

Create a short personal introduction using **Markdown** and **Python code** in a Jupyter notebook.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**🎯 Your Bio Should Include:**

- Your **name** as a level-1 heading (`#`)
- A **photo** of yourself (upload or use a link)
- A brief **synopsis** of who you are
- Academic & professional background
- Experience with Python or other tools
- Use:
  - At least one **list**
  - One **bold/italic** phrase
  - One **Markdown link**
  - (Optional) An **equation** like `$A = \pi r^2$`
:::
::: {.column}
**🧪 Add Some Code Too!**

Write a few short Python cells, such as:

```python
name = "Taylor"
print(f"Hi, my name is {name}!")
```

<br>

<center>

<div id="20minWaiting"></div>
<script src="_extensions/produnis/timer/timer.js"></script>
<script>
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
        initializeTimer("20minWaiting", 1200, "slide"); 
    });
</script>
</center>

##  Don't Discard!

* If you are done, go ahead and print out the PDF of your Colab notebook.
* If not, be sure to return to it later and finish your bio

::: {.callout-important}
You will need to submit the PDF or HTML of your notebook for this week's assignment.

# Data Structures  {background="#43464B"}

## 🧠 Data Structures Trivia

Let’s start with a quick challenge...

<br>

Can you name the 4 built-in data structures we’ve talked about?

. . .

* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Tuples
* Sets

## Quick Comparison {.smaller}

| Structure     | Example Syntax               | Indexing Example        | Use When...                             |
|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `list`        | `["a", "b", "c"]`            | `my_list[0]`            | Order matters; you want to change items |
| `tuple`       | `("x", "y")`                 | `my_tuple[1]`           | Fixed, ordered values                   |
| `dict`        | `{"key": "value"}`           | `my_dict["key"]`        | You need fast lookups by key            |
| `set`         | `{"a", "b", "c"}`            | *(no indexing)*         | You want unique, unordered items        |


<br>

Let's work through each of these in the lab notebook!


# Modules & Libraries  {background="#43464B"}

## 📦 What Are Libraries?

Modules and libraries are **collections of code** that you or others have written to solve common problems.

<br>

Why use them?

. . .

- 🛠 Save time — don’t reinvent the wheel  
- 🚀 Do more — data analysis, web scraping, machine learning, and more  
- 💬 Widely used in industry and academia



## Two Types to Know

- **Standard Library** – Comes with Python (`datetime`, `math`, `random`)
- **Third-Party Libraries** – Must install with `pip` (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`)

::: {.callout-note}
Modules (.py) files are important but we just won't use them a lot in this class.

Let's work through each of these in the lab notebook!

## 🛒 Complete Journey {.smaller}

`completejourney_py` gives you access to real-world retail data from a grocery chain.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Why Use It?**

- It’s **messy** and realistic — just like real business data  
- Helps you practice cleaning, merging, and analyzing  
- Supports questions like:
  - “What types of products are most discounted?”
  - “Do younger households spend more on snacks?”
  - “Which brands drive repeat purchases?”
