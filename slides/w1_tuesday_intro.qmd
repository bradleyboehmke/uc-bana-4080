- The challenge ahead (meet Taylor!)
- Course overview & goals
- AI reality check
- Course roadmap & learning mindset
- Tools & setup preview
- Q&A + student discussion

# What is Data Mining  {background="#43464B"}

## Data Mining is All Around Us {.smaller}

> Organizations use data mining to drive decisions every day.

**Real-World Examples:**

- 🛒 *Kroger analyzes loyalty card data* to personalize digital coupons.
- 🎶 *Spotify recommends music* based on your listening history and those like you.
- 🏥 *Hospitals use patient data* to predict readmission risks.
- 🏈 *NFL teams analyze player movement data* to improve performance and strategy.
- 📦 *Amazon tracks browsing behavior* to recommend products and optimize inventory.

. . .

<br>

::: {.callout-important}
[Every time you browse, click, buy, swipe, or stream — you're generating data.]{style="color:blue;"}
:::

## What Is Data Mining? {.smaller}

> **The process of uncovering meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships in large data sets**

Why is it important?

- 📈 Helps organizations **make better decisions**
- 🔍 Reveals insights that would otherwise go unnoticed
- 🤖 Powers personalization, prediction, and automation
- 💰 Drives business value in nearly every industry

. . .

<br>

## Activity {.smaller}

::: {.callout}
## Where Do You See Data Mining?

🤔 Think about your daily routine — when are you being “mined”?
:::

. . .

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
#### Instructions:

1. **Form groups of 2–3 students**
2. Brainstorm at least **3 examples** where you think data mining is happening in your life
3. We’ll share a few examples as a class

💬 Look for clues in:

- Shopping & entertainment
- Health & fitness
- Social media & tech
- Education or travel

# The Challenge Ahead {background="#43464B"}

## Meet Taylor {.smaller}

**Taylor** is a college junior with a summer internship at a marketing analytics firm.

**Day 1:** The manager hands Taylor a messy spreadsheet and says:

> *"We're trying to understand what drives repeat purchases. Can you dig into this and see what you find?"*

**Taylor freezes.** 😰

. . .

**Taylor has the foundation:**

- Business knowledge ✓
- Statistical thinking ✓  
- Critical thinking ✓

**What's missing?** The ability to turn raw data into actionable insights.

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
[Sound familiar? **That's what this course is about.**]{style="color:blue;"}
:::

# Challenge {background="#43464B"}

## Remember Taylor's Challenge? {.smaller}

Now it's your turn to experience what Taylor felt.

**You'll work with the same type of challenge Taylor faced:**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
You'll get three datasets:

- 🧾 **Customer Transactions** (messy!)
- 🛒 **Product Information**  
- 👥 **Customer Demographics**

**Your mission:** Figure out what drives repeat purchases.

## Group Activity: Where Would You Start? {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Work in groups of 2–3 and discuss:

- 🤔 What kinds of questions could you ask?
- 🔍 What would you look for in the data?
- 🛠️ What tools or skills do you wish you had?
- 💬 What’s hard about this kind of open-ended problem?

Please think about this for 8 minutes.

There’s no “right answer” — this is what real-world analysis looks like.
:::

## Debrief: What Did You Learn? {.smaller}

Let’s talk through what made this challenging:

- 🧭 How did it feel to be given a **vague problem**?
- 📊 What did you want to know about the data before starting?
- 🧠 What tools or skills do you wish you had?
- 💬 Did your group take different approaches?

## Key Takeaways:

- Real-world problems rarely come with clean instructions
- Good data work starts with **asking the right questions**
- This course will help you learn how to **explore**, **analyze**, and **communicate** insights from messy data


::: {.callout-tip}
*We'll come back to this feeling at the end of the semester — you'll be amazed at how much you've grown.*

# Course Overview  {background="#43464B"}

## Why This Matters for YOUR Career {.smaller}

Data is everywhere — but insight is rare.

**No matter your major, this course gives you a competitive edge:**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- 📊 **Business Analytics Students** → Speak the language of data science teams
- 📈 **Marketing Majors** → Understand customer behavior through data, not just theory
- 💵 **Finance Majors** → Model risk, detect fraud, forecast performance with code
:::
::: {.column}
- 👩‍💼 **Management Majors** → Lead data-driven decisions instead of following them
- 🎯 **All Majors** → Collaborate effectively with technical teams

# AI Reality Check {background="#43464B"}

## What About AI? Won't It Do This for Me? {.smaller}

> *"Why do I need to learn coding when ChatGPT can just do it for me?"*

It's a fair question. Let's talk about it honestly.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}
🤖 **AI tools are incredible accelerators**, but they're not magic:

- They don't **understand your business context**
- They can't **ask the right questions** about your data
- They sometimes just **make stuff up**
- They're only as good as **your prompts and interpretation**
:::

## AI Reality Check: It's Like Autocorrect for Code! {.smaller}

::: {.callout-warning}
**Ever had your phone turn "on my way!" into "omg my weasel!"?** 🦫

That's exactly how AI coding tools work — they predict what comes next based on patterns they've seen.

Sometimes they nail it... sometimes you get digital weasels.
:::

. . .

**AI tools are assistants, not autopilots:**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
✅ **AI can help you:**

- Write boilerplate code
- Debug errors
- Learn new syntax
- Generate ideas
:::
::: {.column}
❌ **AI cannot:**

- Understand YOUR data
- Know YOUR business goals
- Ask the right questions
- Guarantee correct answers
:::
::::

## How We'll Use AI in This Course {.smaller}

You'll learn to use AI tools **as learning partners, not crutches:**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**✅ Smart AI Use:**

- Check your understanding
- Help debug when stuck
- Explain concepts differently
- Generate practice examples
- **Always understand what the code does**
:::
::: {.column}
**❌ Avoid This:**

- Copy-paste without understanding
- Skip the learning struggle
- Rely on AI for everything
- Submit AI code you can't explain
