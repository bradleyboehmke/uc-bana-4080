## Today’s Agenda

<br>

- What is data mining?
- Course overview & goals
- Course roadmap
- Tools & setup preview
- Why Python?
- Q&A + student discussion

# What is Data Mining  {background="#43464B"}

## Data Mining is All Around Us {.smaller}

> Organizations use data mining to drive decisions every day.

**Real-World Examples:**

- 🛒 *Kroger analyzes loyalty card data* to personalize digital coupons.
- 🎶 *Spotify recommends music* based on your listening history and those like you.
- 🏥 *Hospitals use patient data* to predict readmission risks.
- 🏈 *NFL teams analyze player movement data* to improve performance and strategy.
- 📦 *Amazon tracks browsing behavior* to recommend products and optimize inventory.

. . .

<br>

::: {.callout-important}
[Every time you browse, click, buy, swipe, or stream — you're generating data.]{style="color:blue;"}
:::

## What Is Data Mining? {.smaller}

> **The process of uncovering meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships in large data sets**

Why is it important?

- 📈 Helps organizations **make better decisions**
- 🔍 Reveals insights that would otherwise go unnoticed
- 🤖 Powers personalization, prediction, and automation
- 💰 Drives business value in nearly every industry

. . .

<br>

## Activity {.smaller}

::: {.callout}
## Where Do You See Data Mining?

🤔 Think about your daily routine — when are you being “mined”?
:::

. . .

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
#### Instructions:

1. **Form groups of 2–3 students**
2. Brainstorm at least **3 examples** where you think data mining is happening in your life
3. We’ll share a few examples as a class

💬 Look for clues in:

- Shopping & entertainment
- Health & fitness
- Social media & tech
- Education or travel

# Challenge {background="#43464B"}

## In-Class Challenge: Your First Day on the Job {.smaller}

🎉 You just landed your first internship or job at a large retail company. On Day 1, your manager says:

> “We’re trying to understand what drives repeat purchases. Can you dig into this and see what you find?”

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
You've been handed three datasets:

- 🧾 **Customer Transactions**
- 🛒 **Product Information**
- 👥 **Customer Demographics**

## Group Activity: Where Would You Start? {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Work in groups of 2–3 and discuss:

- 🤔 What kinds of questions could you ask?
- 🔍 What would you look for in the data?
- 🛠️ What tools or skills do you wish you had?
- 💬 What’s hard about this kind of open-ended problem?

## Debrief: What Did You Learn? {.smaller}

Let’s talk through what made this challenge… challenging:

- 🧭 How did it feel to be given a **vague problem**?
- 📊 What did you want to know about the data before starting?
- 🧠 What tools or skills do you wish you had?
- 💬 Did your group take different approaches?

<br>

### Key Takeaways:
- Real-world problems rarely come with clean instructions
- Good data work starts with **asking the right questions**
- This course will help you learn how to **explore**, **analyze**, and **communicate** insights from messy data


# Course Overview  {background="#43464B"}

## Why Learn Data Mining? {.smaller}

Data is everywhere — but insight is rare.

<br>

**Regardless of your major, data mining gives you a competitive edge:**

- 📊 **Marketing:** Understand customer behavior and optimize campaigns
- 💵 **Finance:** Detect fraud, model risk, and forecast performance
- 🏭 **Operations:** Improve efficiency, forecast demand, reduce waste
- 👩‍💼 **Management:** Support evidence-based decisions across teams

## What About AI? Won’t It Do This for Me? {.smaller}

🤖 AI tools like ChatGPT are amazing — but they don't replace **thinking with data**.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}
- AI can help you write code… but it won’t **ask the right questions**
- AI can summarize data… but it can’t **understand your business context**
- AI is only as good as the **data, prompts, and interpretation** you provide
