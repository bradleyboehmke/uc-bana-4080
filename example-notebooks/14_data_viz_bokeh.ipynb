    "# Interactive Data Visualization with Bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous two lessons, you learned how to visualize data using **pandas**' high-level plotting tools for quick insights, and **matplotlib** for more detailed and customized charting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, youâ€™ll take your visualization skills to the next level with [**Bokeh**](https://bokeh.pydata.org/), a Python library designed for building **interactive visualizations in modern web browsers**. With Bokeh, you can create everything from simple scatterplots to fully-featured, dynamic dashboards â€” all in Python, no JavaScript required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like Bokeh allow you to move beyond static charts and into the world of interactive, responsive data experiences. This shift enables visual storytelling, where users can explore data themselves, and helps you deliver more engaging, stakeholder-friendly output. Whether you're sharing insights with a non-technical audience or designing a data dashboard, Bokeh gives you the flexibility and power to communicate results in more impactful ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Bokeh is considered a lower-level visualization API than pandas or seaborn, it strikes a great balance between ease of use and customizability. Youâ€™ll find it intuitive to get started with and incredibly powerful as you go deeper.\n",

    "Constructing a plot with Bokeh consists of four main steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a figure on which to populate **glyphs** (symbols that represent data, e.g., dots for a scatter plot). Think of this figure as a \"canvas\" which sets the space on which you will \"paint\" your glyphs.\n",
    "2. Defining a data source that is the reference used to place the glyphs.\n",
    "3. Choose the kind of glyph you would like.\n",
    "4. Refining the plot by adding titles, formatted axis labels, or even interactive components.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing these steps, you need to render the graphic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through these steps to generate an interactive scatter plot of home sales price and total living area. So you have the concrete example in mind, the final graphic will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Our first step is creating a figure, our \"canvas.\" In creating the figure, we are implicitly thinking about what kind of representation for our data we want. That is, we have to specify axes and their labels. We might also want to specify the title of the figure, whether or not to have grid lines, and all sorts of other customizations. Naturally, we also want to specify the size of the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Almost) all of this is accomplished in Bokeh by making a call to `bokeh.plotting.figure()` with the appropriate keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more keyword attributes you can assign, including [all of those listed in the Bokeh Plot class](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/models/plots.html#bokeh.models.plots.Plot) and [the additional ones listed in the Bokeh Figure class](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/plotting.html#bokeh.plotting.figure.Figure).\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Now that we have set up our canvas, we can decide on the data source. It is convenient to create a **`ColumnDataSource`**, a special Bokeh object that holds data to be displayed in a plot. (Later on we will see that we can change the data in a `ColumnDataSource` and the plot will automatically update!) Conveniently, we can instantiate a `ColumnDataSource` directly from a Pandas data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "We could also instantiate a data source using a dictionary of arrays, like...\n",
    "\n",
    "`source = bokeh.models.ColumnDataSource(dict(x=[1, 2, 3, 4], y=[1, 4, 9, 16]))`\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Since we are creating a scatter plot we will choose scatter as our glyph. This kind of glyph requires that we specify  which column of the data source will serve to place the glyphs along the $x$-axis and which will serve to place the glyphs along the $y$-axis. We choose the `'GrLivArea'` column to specify the $x$-coordinate of the glyph and the `'SalePrice'` column to specify the $y$-coordinate. Since there are a lot of observations clustered together we can control overplotting by adjusting the transparency with `alpha`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We accomplish step 3 by calling one of the [**glyph methods**](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/plotting.html#scatter-markers) of the Bokeh `Figure` instance, `p`. Since we are choosing a scatter plot, the appropriate method is `p.scatter()`, and we use the `source`, `x`, and `y` kwargs to specify the positions of the glyphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Lastly, we can refine the plot in various ways. In this example we make the x and y-axis labels comma and dollar formatted respectively. We can also add [interactive components](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction.html#userguide-interaction) to our visuals. Here, I add a hover tool so that sale price and total living area is displayed when my mouse hovers over a point. \n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-tip}\n",
    "We can specify these features (axis configuration and tooltips) when we instantiate the figure or afterwards by assigning attribute values to an already instantiated figure. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for a tooltip is a list of 2-tuples, where each tuple represents the tooltip you want. The first entry in the tuple is the label and the second is the column from the data source that has the values. The second entry must be preceded with an `@` symbol signifying that it is a field in the data source and not field that is intrinsic to the plot, which is preceded with a `$` sign. If there are spaces in the column heading, enclose the column name in braces (i.e. `{name with spaces}`). (See the [documentation for tooltip specification](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/tools.html#basic-tooltips) for more information.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have built the plot, we can render it in the notebook using `bokeh.io.show()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In looking at the plot, notice a toolbar to right of the plot that enables you to zoom and pan within the plot."
