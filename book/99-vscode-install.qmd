# VS Code Installation {#sec-vscode-install}

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is a free, lightweight, and powerful code editor used by developers and data scientists around the world. It‚Äôs highly customizable and supports many programming languages and tools‚Äîincluding Python.

VS Code is more than just a text editor. With the right extensions, it can run code, work with Jupyter notebooks, help you manage projects, and even connect to Git for version control. It‚Äôs one of the most widely used environments in the industry and is likely the tool you'll encounter in internships or full-time roles.

While it may feel more advanced than Anaconda Navigator or JupyterLab, VS Code offers more flexibility and control as your projects grow. In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through getting started with VS Code for Python programming and data science.

3. Run the installer and follow the default prompts.

### Windows-Specific Notes:

* Allow the installer to add VS Code to your system **PATH** (this helps you launch it from the command line).
* You can also enable options to open VS Code from the right-click context menu for added convenience.

### macOS-Specific Notes:

* Drag and drop the VS Code application into your **Applications** folder.
* Open it via Spotlight Search (Cmd + Space ‚Üí "Visual Studio Code").

Once installed, you should be able to open VS Code and access its interface. 

   * **On Windows**: Click the Start menu, type "Visual Studio Code," and press Enter. If you checked the box to add VS Code to the system PATH, you can also open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window and type `code` to launch it.
   * **On macOS**: Open Spotlight Search by pressing `Cmd + Space`, type "Visual Studio Code," and press Enter. If you installed the command line tool, you can also open a Terminal window and type `code`.

This should open the VS Code editor which will look like:

In the next section, we‚Äôll help you install the necessary extensions to begin working with Python inside VS Code.

## Installing the Python Extension

To use Python inside VS Code, you'll need two things:

1. **A Python interpreter**: This is the program that actually runs your Python code. If you've already installed Anaconda, you're all set‚ÄîAnaconda includes a Python interpreter. If you haven't (for example, if you're coming straight from using Colab), you'll need to install Python separately. You can download the latest version from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. The official **Python extension** provided by Microsoft: This extension adds support for writing, running, and debugging Python code in VS Code, and helps you work with virtual environments. To install this extension:
    1. Open VS Code.
    2. Click on the **Extensions icon** on the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
    3. In the search bar, type **"Python"** and look for the extension authored by **Microsoft**.
    4. Click **Install**.

Once installed, the Python extension will automatically detect Python interpreters on your system and provide features such as syntax highlighting, auto-complete, linting, and integrated terminal support.

### While You‚Äôre at It: Install These Additional Extensions

To get the most out of VS Code for Python and Jupyter work, we recommend installing the following extensions now:

* **Jupyter**: Enables Jupyter Notebook support within VS Code.
  ![Jupyter extension](images/jupyter-extension.png)
* **Pylance**: Improves code intelligence and type checking.
  ![Pylance extensions](images/pylance-extension.png)

After installing these extensions, you‚Äôre ready to start writing and running Python code in VS Code!

### Understanding Extensions in VS Code

[**Extensions**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/extensions) are small add-ons that enhance the functionality of VS Code. Think of them like plugins‚Äîthey allow you to customize your coding environment based on your needs.

Some extensions help you write and run code in specific languages, while others add support for tools like Git, Jupyter notebooks, or data visualization libraries.

Here are a few common extensions for data science workflows:

* **Python (by Microsoft)** ‚Äì Adds Python language support
* **Jupyter** ‚Äì Enables Jupyter Notebook support
* **Pylance** ‚Äì Adds fast, accurate code intelligence and type checking
* **GitLens** ‚Äì Enhances Git capabilities directly in VS Code
* **Code Runner** ‚Äì Allows you to run snippets of code from many languages

To explore more extensions:

1. Click the **Extensions icon** in the sidebar.
2. Browse featured or recommended extensions.
3. Use the search bar to find tools that match your interests.

::: {.callout-note}
You don‚Äôt need to install a lot of extensions to get started. As you become more experienced, you‚Äôll naturally add tools that support your workflow and projects.

## Creating Your First Jupyter Notebook

Now that VS Code is set up with Python and Jupyter support, let‚Äôs walk through creating your first Jupyter notebook and running a simple Python command.

Steps to Create and Run a Notebook:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Click **File ‚Üí New File ‚Üí select Jupyter Notebook**
    ![New notebook](images/new-notebook.png)
3. Let's go ahead and save this file.  Go to **File ‚Üí Save As** and you can select where you want to save this file to and also rename it (e.g., `hello.ipynb`).
4. VS Code will recognize this as a Jupyter notebook and open an interactive notebook interface.
5. In the first cell, type:
  ```python
  print("Hello VS Code")
  ```
6. Click the **Run Cell** button (the small ‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon) to the left of the cell, or press `Shift + Enter`. You should see the output `Hello VS Code` as below.

## Exploring the VS Code Interface

VS Code is packed with features, but you don‚Äôt need to use them all right away. As you become more comfortable with VS Code and your data science skills grow, you‚Äôll naturally start using more of its capabilities. Here are some of the features you‚Äôll find yourself using most often:

* **Explorer (üìÅ icon)**: View and manage your project files.
* **Run and Debug (‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon)**: Run code or set up debugging tools.
* **Extensions (üîå icon)**: Install and manage extensions.
* **Integrated Terminal**: Open a terminal inside VS Code using `Ctrl + `` or `Cmd + \`\` (backtick).
* **Notebook Interface**: When working in `.ipynb` files, you can use cells to write and run code interactively.

If the interface feels overwhelming at first, don‚Äôt worry. Start by focusing on writing and running Python code‚Äîover time, you'll naturally grow into the more advanced features.
