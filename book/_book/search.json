    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to BANA 4080: Introduction to Data Mining with Python. This course provides an immersive, hands-on introduction to the tools and techniques used in modern data science. You’ll learn how to explore, analyze, and model data using Python and gain practical experience through labs, projects, and real-world datasets.\nAlong the way you will develop core skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and even key machine learning techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning model. We’ll even take a quick detour into generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Throughout this process we’ll use real-world data and experiential learning to guide your learning.\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:",
